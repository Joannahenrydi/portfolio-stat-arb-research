# Cross-Asset Statistical Arbitrage & Trend Research Platform

Research platform for cross-asset trend, equity statistical arbitrage, cost-aware portfolio
construction, walk-forward validation and fail-closed paper execution.

> **Current decision: REJECTED.** Cross-asset trend showed economically meaningful development
> performance under risk-budgeted construction, but failed stability gates across regimes. No
> strategy was promoted and paper orders remain disabled.

## Latest evidence

The project began with U.S. equity residual alpha and evolved into a 45-ETF multi-asset platform
covering equities, rates, credit, metals, commodities and currencies. The main research finding is
that portfolio construction is no longer the binding constraint: price-only alpha loses stability
after 2017.

| Frozen experiment | Train net Sharpe | Development net Sharpe | Net CAGR | Max drawdown | Decision |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| v13 exact-neutral trend | -0.444 | -0.715 | -0.74% development | -4.28% development | Reject |
| v13 risk-budgeted trend | 0.726 | **0.638** | **5.16% development** | -16.43% development | Reject: drawdown |
| v15 time-series trend | 0.688 | 0.547 | 4.33% development | **-14.68% development** | Reject: return gates |
| v16 50/50 trend ensemble | **0.865** | 0.431 | 8.47% train / 3.35% development | -14.25% train / -15.16% development | Reject: instability |
| v18 expanded-universe winner | **0.823** | 0.212 | 7.25% train / 1.41% development | **-13.64% train** / -12.93% development | Reject: instability |

v13 isolated a construction error in v12: forcing equity, duration, credit, commodity and USD
exposure to exactly zero removed the macro trend the strategy was meant to earn. Replacing exact
neutrality with explicit risk budgets raised development net Sharpe from -0.715 to 0.638. Later
versions added time-series momentum, train-only ensemble selection, 45-ETF universe expansion and
risk-target selection. These improved training performance and drawdown control, but the first
development evaluation remained too weak for promotion.

The 2021–2024 locked test was never evaluated in v13–v18 because no candidate passed development
and kill-test gates. The next research cycle requires a distinct information source such as futures
carry/term structure, intraday/overnight decomposition, macro surprises, PIT earnings/revisions or
historical borrow data.

## Research capabilities

- Point-in-time-aware data gates and explicit data-quality labels.
- Cross-sectional residual, adaptive Kalman, price/volume and cross-asset trend alpha families.
- Exact equity beta/sector neutrality and risk-budgeted macro portfolio construction.
- Covariance risk, gross/net/name/factor/sleeve, turnover and ADV participation constraints.
- Commission, spread, slippage, square-root impact and borrow-cost accounting.
- Frozen train/development/test protocols, delay/cost/universe kill tests and locked-test controls.
- Alpaca paper execution that emits no orders unless every promotion gate passes.

## Equity research foundation

The original Alpaca equity panel contains SIP raw/all-adjusted daily bars for 503 current candidates
and SPY, a liquid top-400 universe and a 356-name continuous-history research cohort. Those results
remain labeled `research_snapshot_only`: Alpaca's current asset master cannot certify historical
membership or remove survivor bias. The code retains strict bitemporal PIT gates for vendor data
that can provide historical security-master records.

## Repository structure

- `data/`: bitemporal universes, effective/available-time checks and historical-identity gates.
- `features/`: residual reversal, Kalman innovation, volume/volatility alpha and train calibration.
- `models/`: stable interfaces for calibration and covariance models.
- `portfolio/`: beta/sector/style neutralization and cost-aware portfolio optimization.

A two-to-three-month prospective paper record must accumulate on future trading days; historical
backtests cannot substitute for it.
